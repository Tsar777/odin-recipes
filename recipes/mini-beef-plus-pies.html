        <figcaption>Crisp and Golden Yet Tender Inside</figcaption>
        <p>Succulent, crisp but melts like butter or icing sugar in the mouth</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 eggs</li>
            <li>500g lean beef mince</li>
            <li>150g chorizo-style sausage skinned and crumbled</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds, crushed</li>
            <li>Finely chopped flat-leaf parsley to make 3 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Half teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>500g ready-made shortcrust pastry</li>
            <li>1 egg beaten to glaze</li>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Drop the eggs into boiling water and cook for 2 mins then plunge the into iced water. Peel the eggs when they are completely cool.</li>
                <li>Put the mince, chorizo, fennel, parsley, and paprika in a large bowl and add 1 teaspoon sea salt and half teaspoon ground black pepper.Mix thoroughly with clean hands. Fry a tiny piece of the mixture to che the seasoning. Add accordingly if need be.</li>
                <li>Heat the oven to 190 degrees celsius. Roll 2/3 of the pastry to 20p thickness then cut circles big enough to line 10 holes of a muffin tin. Line the holes with the 10 circles of pastry, then fill each half full with mince mixture. Make a little indent in the mince in each pie and sit an egg in each indent, then cover the egg with the remaining mince mixture. Roll out the rest of the pastry and top every pie, crimping the edges together with a fork. Glaze the pies with the egg then use a knife to make a little steam hole in each.</li>
                <li>Bake the pies for 40 mins, then let the cool completely in the tin before removing.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
