        <p>Sweet and Tangy Four Bean Salad is an old-fashioned potluck favorite that you probably remember your grandmother making. Beans, celery, red onion, and pimentos are marinated in a sweet and tangy dressing. This delicious recipe is the perfect make-ahead solution. Simply combine green beans, red kidney beans, soybeans and wax beans with a bold dressing of cider vinegar, dry red wine, mustard and garlic. Who doesn't love an easy three bean salad, perfect for summer picnics and potlucks?! This classic American picnic salad has cannellini beans, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, celery, red onion, parsley, and a sweet and sour dressing. This is a delicious salad-- I never really liked three-bean salad before this one! It's sweet and tangy at the same time and full of wonderful textures!</p>
