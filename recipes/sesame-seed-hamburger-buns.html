        <p>Sesame seeds have many potential health benefits and have been used in folk medicine for thousands of years. They may protect against heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. The sesame plant, Sesamum indicum, produces seeds that contain protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Sesame seeds also provide calcium, B vitamins, vitamin E, and antioxidants. With a nutty crunch and sweet flavour, sesame seeds are a popular ingredient used extensively in Indian cooking. They come in distinct colours - black, white and brown, and are also used in extracting sesame oil. Much like other cooking oils, sesame oil lends well to the flavours of the dishes being prepared. In the kitchen, the seeds can be used in numerous ways to prepare a range of delicacies -  from traditional sweet treats of the country and sumptuous snacks to lip-smacking accompaniments and atop garden fresh salads.
