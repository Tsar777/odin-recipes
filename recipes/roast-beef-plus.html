        <p>Beef roasting is timeless. Slow-roasting on low heat works magical wonders on tougher cut of meat and provides tender roast beef which puts smiles on the bearers. Roast beef might sound fancy  and complicated to make, but it's actually quite simple! With a good piece of meat and some simple herbs, you can have roast beef that's way more tender and flavorful than the store-bought kind. Below, we break down what's most important to know when preparing this classic dish.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2kg topside beef</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil or sunflower oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon English mustard powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Maldon sea salt</li>
            <li>2 large carrots, halved length-ways</li>
            <li>12 banana shallots, peeled and halved length-ways</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plain flour</li>
            <li>300ml full-bodied red wine(optional)</li>
            <li>500ml fresh beef stock</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons redcurrant jelly</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>t the meat come to room temperature before you roast it. Heat oven to 220 degrees celsius. Dry the meat with kitchen paper, then rub the oil all over it. Mix the mustard powder with the sea salt and 1 teaspoon pepper, then rub this over the meat too. Lay the carrots in a large roasting tin to make trivet and sit the beef on top, fat side up.</li>
            <li>Roast for 15 mins, then turn the heat down to 180 degrees celsius and roast for another 55 mins. This will give you medium beef; for medium-rare, cook for 45 mins</li>
            <li>With 30 mins cooking time left, baste the beef in the fat that has pooled in the tin, add the shallots and bay leaves, and coat these in the fat too. Season and return to the oven. Meanwhile, boil the wine in a small saucepan to reduce it by two-thirds.</li>
            <li>When the meat is ready, transfer to a board, cover loosely with foil and leave to rest. Turn the oven up to 200 degrees celsius and return the tin to the oven for a further 10-15 mins until the shallots are tender.</li>
            <li>Scoop out the shallots with a slotted spoon and set aside to keep warm. Remove excess fat from the tin and discard, leaving 1 tablespoon fat and all the dark juices behind. Add flour and cook on the hob for 2 mins, stirring constantly. Gradually, whisk in the reduced wine, followed by the stock and redcurrant jelly, scraping up all the tasty bits from the bottom of the tin. Bubble until thickened and rich, add the juices from the resting meat, then season to taste. Discard the carrots. Serve the beef with the gravy and shallots.</li>
