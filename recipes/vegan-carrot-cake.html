                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>Half teaspoon salt</li>

                <li>255g grated carrots</li>
                <li>2 flax eggs(2 tablespoons ground flaxseed meal with 6 tablespoons water</li>
                <li>Half cup canola oil or vegetable oil(120ml)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>100g(1 Cup) Walnuts chopped(chopped)</li><br>
                <span>For the lemon buttercream frosting:</span>
                <li>480g(4cups) powdered sugar</li>
                <li>112g(Half cup) vegan butter</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>2-3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees celsius. Spray two 7-inch cake pans or 8-inch cake pans with non-stick spray and line the bottoms with circle of parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Sift the all purpose flour into a mixing bowl and add the baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Mix together.</li>
                <li>Add the light brown sugar and grated carrots to the mixing bowl</li>
                <li>Prepare your flax eggs by adding 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed meal to a bowl with 6 tablespoons of hot water. Let it sit for a minute to become gloopy.</li>
                <li>Add the flax eggs, oil, vanilla extract, apple cider vinegar and chopped walnuts to the mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Mix everything together. If it seems like it wont come together and the mix is too dry then step away from the bowl for a couple of minutes and then come back to it. The carrots will have released more moisture into the batter allowing it to come together into a thick batter.</li>
                <li>Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans</li>
                <li>Bake for 30 mins  or until a toothpick inserted into the centre of one of the cakes comes out clean</li>
                <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire cooling rack to coll completely</li>
                <li>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the frosting</li>
                <li>Add the powdered sugar, vegan butter, vanilla extract, apple cider vinegar, and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to the bowl of your stand mixer</li>
                <li>Start mixing on low speed gradually increasing speed until your frosting is thick and smooth</li>
                <li>If your frosting is too thick then add in the extra tablespoon of lemon juice, a drop at a time and only as much as is needed to get a spreadable consistency</li>
                <li>Frost the cake and decorate the top with chopped walnuts</li>
