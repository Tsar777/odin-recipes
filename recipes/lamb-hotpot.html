        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>700g large potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sunflower oil, plus extra for brushing</li>
            <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
            <li>4 carrots, chopped into small pieces</li>

            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 thyme sprigs</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Boil the potatoes in a saucepan for 15 mins until parboiled, then drain and leave to steam dry and cool</li>
                <li>Heat oven to 200 degrees celsius. Heat oil in a large frying pan and fry the onions for about 10 mins. Add the carrots and cook for 5 mins until tender. Tip the carrot and onion mixture into a large ovenproof bowl. Put back the pan on heat and turn to high. Fry the lamb meatballs, turning until golden on the outside. Put the meatballs in the ovenproof bowl. Pour over the gravy and tuck in the bay leaves and the thyme sprigs</li>
                <li>Thinly slice the cooled potatoes and arrange over the top of the meatballs. Brush the potatoes with 1-2 teaspoons oil and add a good grinding of black pepper. Bake in the oven for 20-25 mins until the potatoes are tender and starting to become crisp at the edges and the gravy is bubbling</li>
