        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2 carrots, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 free range chicken</li>
            <li>1 lemon, halved</li>
            <li>small bunch thyme(optional)</li>
            <li>25g butter, softened</li><br>
            <span>For The Gravy</span><br>
            <li>1 tablespoon plain flour</li>
            <li>250ml chicken stock(a cube is fine)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 190 degrees celsius. Have a shelf ready in the middle of the oven without any shelves above it.</li>
            <li>Scatter 1 roughly chopped onion and 2 roughly chopped carrots over the base of a roasting tin that fits the whole chicken, but does'nt swamp it.</li>
            <li>Season the cavity of the chicken liberally with salt and pepper, then stuff with 2 lemon halves and a small bunch of thyme, if using.</li>
            <li>Sit the roast-chicken on the vegetables smother the breast and legs all over with 25g softened butter, then season the outside with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place in the oven and leave, undisturbed, for 1 hour 20 mins- this will give you a perfectly roasted chicken. To check, pierce the thigh with a skewer and the juices should run clear.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the tin from the oven and, using a pair of tongs, lift the chicken to a dish or board to rest for 15-20 mins. As you lift the chicken to a dish, let any juices from the chicken pour out of the cavity into the roasting tin.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is resting, make the gravy. Place the roasting tin over a low flame, then stir in 1 tablespoon flour and sizzle until you have a light brown, sandy paste.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour in  250ml chicken stock, stirring all the time, until you have a thickened sauce.</li>
            <li>Simmer for 2 mins, using a wooden spoon to stir, scraping any sticky bits from the tin.</li>
            <li>Strain the gravy into a small saucepan, then simmer and season to taste. When you carve the bird, add any extra juices to the gravy</li>
        </ol>
