        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g block all-butter shortcrust pastry</li>
            <li>5 eggs at room temperature</li>
            <li>200g thick-cut bacon, rind and fat removed and chopped</li>
            <li>6 herb pork sausages, skins removed</li>
            <li>400g lean pork mince</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fennel seeds, toasted and crushed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tarragon, chopped</li>
            <li>1 egg beaten to glaze with</li>
            <li>200g all-butter pastry</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oven to 190 degrees celsius. Butter a 900g non-stick loaf tin. Cut a strip of baking paper the same width as the tin and and line it, leaving the edges overhanging</li>
                <li>Roll out the shortcrust pastry to the thickness of a pound coin</li>
                <li>Use the pastry to line the tin. Carefully push it into the corners and mould it to fit the shape of the tin, leaving a bit of pastry overhanging. Cook the eggs in boiling water for 7 mins. Put in iced water to cool completely then peel off the shells.</li>
                <li>Put the bacon, sausages,mince, fennel and other herbs in a bowl with 1 teaspoon salt and half teaspoon black pepper. Mix well using clean hands. Put half the mince mix in the bottom of the tin.</li>
                <li>Using your fingers, make a dip in the middle of the mince mixture that's big enough to fit the eggs.</li>
                <li>Cut the ends off all the eggs so you can line them up neatly end to end</li>
                <li>Cover the eggs with the rest of the mince mixture, making sure it fits snugly around the eggs. Level the top.</li>
                <li>Brush the edges of the shortcrust pastry with some of the beaten eggs.</li>
                <li>Roll out the puff to 20p coin thickness and drape it over the top of the tin, pushing down gently so it sticks to the shortcrust.</li>
                <li>Carefully trim the edges with a pair of kitchen scissors.</li>
                <li>Crimp the edges with your fingers.</li>
                <li>Lightly score the top and glaze with the rest of the egg. Make a hole, put on a baking tray and bake for an hour. Cool in the tin then chill overnight. Turn out and cut into thick slices.</li>
