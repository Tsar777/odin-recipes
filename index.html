        <p>When the Odin assignment directed me to create recipes, I thought to myself, "How on Earth am I going to achieve this?" A couple of steps further down, I found myself staring at a boring meaningless webpage. However, thanks to wonderful and beautiful people who allow us novices to use their materials on the net I got buoyed up and encouraged. Many thanks to all such people that I borrowed from to make this project a success. May The Almighty GOD bless them abundantly.</p>
        <p>The selected recipes I have grouped together are not based on any scientific or methodological connotations. Rather, they were arbitrarily selected not on merit but to enhance and horn my skills on coding. Some of them were taken from my wife's handbook of Cookery.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the recipes herein listed are not hard-wired to the stated ingredients. Anyone is encouraged and free to add or subtract some item(s) in the list of ingredients to suit their needs.</p>
